The kumbhakars or potters in the Panchmura village of Bishnupur in Bankura district are less than a hundred families today. These men and women have carried on their robust shoulders the 1,000-year heritage of making terracotta products — mainly horse figurines or tiles made of baked earth. But the virus has played havoc with the livelihood in this village. The crackling sound of slow-roasted or fired clay is silent today as products have become hard to sell. Covid cases in the village have meant that the artists have had to find other jobs to pay for medical expenses, with several craftsmen being forced to abandon their art.\n<img src="https://images.hindustantimes.com/rf/image_size_960x540/HT/p2/2018/05/28/Pictures/_79ae4d7c-6235-11e8-b5ac-da6b7874835f.jpg" width="640" height="400" />\n\n#Problems with government help\n###Local Governmental bodies have focused more on healthcare services, being unable to direct significant resources to support the economic needs of the craftsmen. They are encouraging the villagers to go online and set up an online market for their products. Villagers, however, are flummoxed at the very prospect of going online. Poor Internet penetration, problems of packaging and transportation are just some examples of issues the artisans face.\n![Picture 1](https://i.ibb.co/xX7sY2W/Picture2.png)\n\n#Role of \'A New Hope\'\n###This is where \'A New Hope\' comes in.
